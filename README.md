# Colour name app

Starting my learning experience with react by building something. 

The idea is to create a chrome extension and learn react (killing two birds with one stone). The chrome extension will allow the user to input a hex colour, that colour will be evaluated against a list of colour names provided by [Name that Color JavaScript](http://chir.ag/projects/ntc/). 
The app will spit out the official name of the colour based on the list, show the official colour and the colour entered by the user and allow the user to copy to clipboard a SASS variable with the colour name and hex value. 

Example of output text
`$black: #000000;`

## To Do:
	
 - update to react 16
 - notification system (copied to clipboard, errors, etc)
 - copy to clipboard
 - user experience improvements
 - multiple hex codes at one - omg do I dare
 - try it as extension
